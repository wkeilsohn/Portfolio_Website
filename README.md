## Portfolio Website

A website for displaying all my current work.

# Original Use:

The orginal use of this website was/is to allow me to show off my current coding projects and to expand my java coding experiance.

# Curent Status:

Due to issues with how java is run in terms of web based applications, I have currently moved my work over to another repository. This repository is currently located:

- https://github.com/wkeilsohn/Portfolio_Website_V2

Should the need arise, I may move/adjust my code further to better suit my needs.
